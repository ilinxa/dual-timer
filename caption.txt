⏱️ I built a chess-style work timer — and it’s changed how I measure productivity.

Instead of guessing how long I worked, I now actually know.
✅ Green = Focused work
⏸️ Red = Breaks, distractions, pauses

Every time I get distracted, I switch the timer — just like in chess.
When I come back? Switch back.

At the end of the day, I see exactly how much time I spent in deep work — no fluff, no assumptions.

💡 Built with pure HTML, CSS & JS.
🖤 Sleek dark UI with animated glow & background blur.
⚡ Simple. Honest. Effective.

Because real productivity isn’t about being busy —
it’s about being focused.
